23,"Unfortunately,all biomedical and scienti ﬁc research into these psychedelic
substances ceased upon passage of the 1970 ControlledSubstances Act, which classi ﬁed these compounds as Schedule I,
the category reserved for the most dangerous and abusable of all
illicit drugs.","['Unfortunately', 'Schedule', 'Act']"
24,"However, in recent years, grassroots efforts and shifting
public opinion have led to these ancient medicines being once againobjects of intensive scienti ﬁc scrutiny and their clinical potential is
being explored.
For instance, randomized double-blind clinical trials have
shown psychedelic-assisted therapy to be highly ef ﬁcacious in
treating treatment-resistant depression (TRD), major depressivedisorder (MDD) post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
substance abuse disorders (SUD) ( Mithoefer et al., 2019 ;Carhart-
Harris1 et al., 2018 ;Noorani et al., 2018 ;Gasser et al., 2014 ).","['Mithoefer', 'Noorani', 'For', 'Carhart', 'However', 'Gasser']"
25,"Of note,
3,4-Methyl enedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severePTSD was found to cause symptom remission or reduction thatpersisted for up to 3.5 years after therapy ( Mithoefer et al., 2013 ).
The recently published phase 3 clinical trial results for MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD showed that 67% of patients no longer
met the PTSD criteria, 21% had a clinically signi ﬁcant response, and
12% had no response, while the placebo with therapy group had 32%of patients no longer meeting the PTSD criteria, 30% with a clinicallymeaningful response, and 30% with no response ( Mitchell et al.,
2021 ).","['Methyl', 'Mithoefer', 'Mitchell', 'The']"
26,"The remarkable clinical ef ﬁcacy has culminated in the
opening of multi-million-dollar research centers to investigatetherapeutic applications of psychedelics at Johns HopkinsUniversity, Imperial College London, and University of
California-Berkeley.
Despite this recent surge in psychedelic research, the full range
of effects and biological mechanisms of action are far fromunderstood ( Garcia-Romeu et al., 2016 ;Flanagan and Nichols,
2018 ).","['Johns', 'Despite', 'Nichols', 'Imperial', 'Flanagan', 'The', 'Romeu', 'London', 'College', 'Garcia', 'California', 'University', 'Berkeley']"
27,"Most clinical research has been focused on assessing the
psychological –rather than basic physiological –mechanisms of
psychedelics.",['Most']
28,"Given these compounds ability to inducetransformative and personally meaningful experiences, which
correlate with positive behavioral changes, there is a tendency to
disregard how psychedelics modulate physiological processes.Psychological wellbeing, however, is interwoven with variousphysiological systems, e.g., proper neuroendocrine andinﬂammatory function.","['Psychological', 'Given']"
29,"Understanding the non-psychological
effects of psychedelics may also allow for development of a rangeof novel clinical applications.",['Understanding']
30,"We suggest that such foundationalinvestigations will require multi-disciplinary investigations which
leverage the collective strengths of in silico ,in vitro ,in vivo models of
homeostatic as well as injury or disease-based conditions.
2 Current trends in psychedelic
research
Plant medicines containing psychedelic compounds, such as
ayahuasca, peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, played a central spiritual
and medicinal role in indigenous cultures for millennia ( Naples,
2013 ;Armijos et al., 2014 ;Carod-Artal, 2015 ;Jay, 2019 ;Arie et al.,
2020 ).","['Artal', 'Arie', 'Carod', 'Armijos', 'Plant', 'Current', 'Jay', 'Naples']"
31,"Psychedelics do not have a universally sharedpharmacological action or chemical structure, and are often
deﬁned by the profound and meaningful subjective psychedelic
experiences they induce, e.g., a dissolution of the ego,a“mystical ”
phenomenological experience, and impairment of spatiotemporalprocessing ( Krupitsky et al., 2002 ;Dakwar et al., 2014 ;Zanos et al.,
2018 ).","['Psychedelics', 'Zanos', 'Krupitsky', 'Dakwar']"
32,"However, these experiences can also be induced by non-
psychedelic compounds, such as the fast-acting antidepressant
dissociative ketamine.",['However']
33,"Thus, rather than a strict all-encompassingdeﬁnition, the categorization of these diverse drugs as “psychedelics ”
is somewhat arbitrary.
Psychedelics may be organized into distinct classes based on
their structural characteristics: 1) tryptamines , such as psilocin (the
active form of psilocybin) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT); 2)lysergamides , such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); 3)
phenethylamines , including 3,4-Methyl
enedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI); 4) cannabinoids like Δ-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol ;and 5) terpenoids , such as Salvinorin A
(Szabo, 2015 ).","['Salvinorin', 'Methyl', 'Szabo', 'Thus', 'Psychedelics']"
34,"Although, psychedelics may also be categorized by
their pharmacological action (serotonergic, glutamatergic,dopaminergic, etc.), they often have a complex pharmacologicalproﬁle.",['Although']
35,"Ultimately, action on a single receptor type cannot
adequately explain their acute or chronic effects ( Garcia-Romeu
et al., 2016 ;Zamberlan et al., 2018 ).","['Ultimately', 'Romeu', 'Zamberlan', 'Garcia', 'receptor']"
36,"Further research into
psychedelic compounds and the mechanisms that mediate theirclinical ef ﬁcacy may eventually allow for a more meaningful
classi ﬁcation schema.
2.1 Need for preclinical and mechanistic
studies
Although psychedelics have great therapeutic promise, the
psychophysiological theories explaining how psychedelicsmanifest their clinical effects are nascent.","['Need', 'Although', 'Further']"
37,"Research leveragingbrain imaging techniques has played a signi ﬁcant role in
addressing this gap in knowledge.",['Research']
38,"For example, it appears thatcharacteristics of the psychedelic experience are constructed by a
combination of diminished top-down modulation of sensory
processing, an increase in the total content of one ’s sensorium,
and functional disintegration of distributed networks.",['For']
39,Carhart-Harris et al.,"['Carhart', 'Harris']"
40,"formulated the Relaxed Brain Under Psychedelics(REBUS) model of psychological annealing under psychedelics,which posits that psychedelics induce a state ofneuropsychological plasticity under which embedded cognitivebiases can be re-written.","['Psychedelics', 'Relaxed', 'Brain', 'Under']"
41,"This a framework helps explain why
psychedelics can aid in treatment of such a wide array of
psychiatric disorders ( Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019 ).
While human brain research, particularly neuroimaging, has
been instrumental in advancing our understanding of thepsychedelic experience, identi ﬁcation of novel therapeutic targets,
and understanding possible modes of action.","['This', 'While', 'Friston', 'Harris', 'Carhart']"
42,"Undeniably, the mainstrength of human neuroimaging research is that it allows foridenti ﬁcation of neural correlates of speci ﬁc elements of the
subjective experience, such as those assessed by the mystical
experience questionnaire, which are impossible to isolate inanimal models.",['Undeniably']
43,"However, human neuroimaging research has itslimits.",['However']
44,"For instance, there is huge variability in how studies are
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 02Acero et al.","['Pharmacology', 'Frontiers', 'For']"
45,"Moreover, the small
sample sizes and lack of standards for the ﬁeld makes it dif ﬁcult to
pool together datasets in order to generate larger sample sizesnecessary for reproducible brain-wide association studies ( Marek
et al., 2022 ).","['Moreover', 'Marek', 'gene']"
46,"Moreover, it is highly correlational due to its low
spatiotemporal resolution and non-ideal for robust probing ofcellular mechanisms.",['Moreover']
47,"This is where in vitro and in vivo research
comes into play –these experimental approaches allow for more
high-throughput, mechanistic understanding of how psychedelicseffect neuronal circuits and cellular processes, and thus complimentthe insights derived from human neuroimaging studies.
Historically, for a diverse class of compounds, robust preclinical
in vitro and in vivo research has been vital for establishing a
foundational pharmacological understanding and will thereforebe crucial in advancing our understanding of psychedelics.","['This', 'Historically']"
48,"Forinstance, animal models permit invasive measurements that areimpossible with humans, yet this has been poorly leveraged in theﬁeld.",['Forinstance']
49,"Speci ﬁcally, in vitro orin vivo electrophysiology studies using
techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution could be utilized toexplore characterized processes for mediating spatial and temporal
processing.",['Speci']
50,"For instance, Domenico et al.","['Domenico', 'For']"
51,"found LSD impaired
communication between cortical sensory circuits andhippocampal place cells, and triggered oscillatory activity whichnaturally occurs during wakefulness-to-sleep transitions ( Domenico
et al., 2021 ).",['Domenico']
52,"This helps further understand the neurological
substrate for hallucinatory experiences.",['This']
53,"Extending beyond therealm of neuroscience, animal models have also contributed toour understanding of the broader pharmacological properties of
psychedelic compounds.",['Extending']
54,"For instance, rodent models of allergic
asthma were utilized to screen serotonergic compounds for maximalanti-in ﬂammatory effects and elucidate the pathways necessary for
anti-in ﬂammatory action in lung tissue ( Flanagan et al., 2021 ).
While mammalian models are traditionally used for assessmentsof cellular and molecular mechanisms, there are alternative high-throughput models that would be ideal for preliminary screeningand characterization of novel psychedelic compounds in healthy and
diseased individuals.","['Flanagan', 'While', 'For']"
55,"For instance, the zebra ﬁsh (Danio rerio ) model
has a fully characterized genome and nervous system, is low-costand high throughput, and has high physiological homology tohumans ( Neelkantan et al., 2013 ).","['Neelkantan', 'Danio', 'For']"
56,"Moreover, the response of this
model to various psychedelic compounds has been wellcharacterized ( Neelkantan et al., 2013 ).
Furthermore, due to regulatory and ﬁnancial barriers to
psychedelic research, only a relatively narrow range of
compounds have been thoroughly investigated.","['Moreover', 'Furthermore', 'Neelkantan']"
57,"In fact, Dr.
Alexander Shulgin ’sPiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story is an
astonishing chemical catalog of over 170 novel psychedeliccompounds (including MDMA) which has been largely ignoredacross in vitro, in vivo , and, especially, human studies ( Dean et al.,
2013 ).","['Shulgin', 'Dean', 'Story', 'Chemical', 'Alexander', 'Love']"
58,"While there are in vivo studies involving rodent or zebra ﬁsh
models, these studies often only assess effects of non-scheduledcompounds like 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodamphetamine (DOI).
Furthermore, most studies lack informative comparisons across
different psychedelics, often due to the dif ﬁculty of acquiring
multiple compounds.","['Furthermore', 'While']"
59,"However, there are some landmark studies,e.g., which conduct robust comparisons across various psychedeliccompounds with distinct pharmacological pro ﬁ
les.",['However']
60,"Such studies
include Ly et al.",['Such']
61,"(2018) that provided a robust characterization of
the plasticity promoting effects of psychedelics and the cellularsignaling pathways which mediating these effects, and Nardou
et al.",['Nardou']
62,"While such studies have
robust cross-drug comparisons, they often focus on otherwise wellstudied compounds (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, ketamine,ibogaine), and there still remains a need to examine understudiedclasses of psychedelic compounds, such as the 2C series drugs (ring-substituted phenethylamines).",['While']
63,"It could be advantageous to expandour investigation of psychedelics to include more compounds inorder to build a robust understanding of their effects and
mechanisms, and discover more nuanced therapeutic applications
for distinct compounds.
The utility of in silico research, i.e., computational models and
simulations, in psychedelic research has become increasinglyevident.",['The']
64,"A noteworthy example of the application ofcomputational models is the Wacker et al study that revealed thecrystal structure of an LSD-bond human 5-HT
2Areceptor using
molecular dynamics smulations ( Wacker et al., 2017 ).","['Wacker', 'receptor']"
65,"This work
delineated the active-state structure of the bound receptor, providing
crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms underlyingpsychedelic actions, thereby potentially accelerating drugdiscovery for a variety of novel compounds as well ( Wacker
et al., 2017 ).","['This', 'receptor', 'Wacker']"
66,"Moreover, recent advancements in arti ﬁcial
intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) technology areincreasing the functionality and utility of in silico approaches for
psychedelic research.",['Moreover']
67,"By utilizing predictive models based on the
structure-activity relationship (SAR) of known psychedelic
molecules, AI algorithms can generate new compounds withimproved pharmacological properties and reduced side effects.Such techniques are especially useful in processing large datasets,which is an essential aspect of drug discovery.","['Such', 'gene']"
68,"Such tools are alreadybeing utilized by numerous drug companies (e.g., EnvericBiosciences, April19 Discovery and PharmaTher) to help identifynovel psychedelic compounds with minimal adverse effects and
maximal therapeutic bene ﬁts.","['Such', 'Discovery']"
69,"Moreover, analyzing large datasets of
clinical and preclinical studies, machine learning algorithms canidentify patterns of treatment response and predict the optimaldosing regimens for speci ﬁc patient populations.",['Moreover']
70,"Also, the
emergence of VR platforms for medicinal chemistry, e.g.,Nanome, has allowed for a 3D visualization of molecular(crystal-based and ligand-based) structures which captures detailsoften lost in 2D visualizations ( Zhavoronkov et al., 2020 ).","['Zhavoronkov', 'Also', 'Nanome']"
71,"Second, we will discuss what is known

72,"Finally, we propose
novel directions for psychedelic research, and relevant in vivo and
in vitro research models that may complement future investigations.
2.2 Clinical use of psychedelics
Modern clinical use of psychedelics began with LSD- and
psilocybin-assisted therapy targeted at alleviating existentialdistress, depression, and anxiety in patients with life-threateningillnesses ( Gasser et al., 2014 ;Ross et al., 2016 ).","['Ross', 'Finally', 'Clinical', 'Modern', 'Gasser']"
73,"More importantly, thesestudies demonstrated the safety of psychedelic administrationwithin clinical settings, speci ﬁcally for alleviation of psychological
suffering.",['More']
74,"Since then, psychedelics have continued to occupy aspotlight in neuropsychopharmacology by producing similarlyrobust and long-lasting bene ﬁts in the treatment of SUD, MDD,
and PTSD.",['Since']
75,"Interestingly, the ef ﬁcacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy
was signi ﬁcantly correlated with the personal meaningfulness and
occurrence of a “mystical experience ”(Gasser et al., 2014 ;Grifﬁths
et al., 2016 ;Ross et al., 2016 ).","['Ross', 'Interestingly', 'Gasser']"
76,"Yet, as is the case with most
psychedelic clinical targets, it is unclear to what extent theclinical ef ﬁcacy is mediated by bottom-up neurobiological
modulation as opposed to a top-down cognitive mechanism.",['Yet']
77,"Wewill cover these clinical applications brie ﬂy, as they have already
been thoroughly discussed in other reviews.
2.2.1 Substance use disorders
SUD is a complex disorder with genetic, environmental, and
psychosocial etiologies.","['Wewill', 'gene', 'Substance']"
78,"It is characterized by persistent craving and/or continued and excessive use leading to dysfunctional behavior.While addiction research has helped uncover alterations todopaminergic circuit function and reward signaling pathways,these alterations are not predictive of an individual ’s capacity for
relapse and have not led to meaningful therapeutic interventions
(Hart, 2017 ;Miller et al., 2020 ).","['While', 'Hart', 'Miller']"
79,"Studies utilizing psychedelic-assisted
psychotherapy have shown promising results for improvingrecovery from this complex disease.",['Studies']
80,"Psychedelics like psilocybin,ibogaine, ayahuasca, and ketamine have been shown to facilitateabstinence from nicotine, opioids, alcohol, and cocaine respectively,as well as facilitate overall positive effects on anxiety, mood, anddepression as well ( Re et al., 2016 ;Brown and Alper, 2018 ;Jones
et al., 2018 ;Noorani et al., 2018 ).
2.2.2 Major depressive disorder and treatment
resistant depression
MDD accounts for over 50% of psychiatric consultations and is
characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest.","['Major', 'Noorani', 'Brown', 'Psychedelics', 'Jones', 'Alper']"
81,"However, due to the lack of a
clear de ﬁnition - often interpreted as insuf ﬁcient response to two
antidepressant trials - estimates of its prevalence in the MDDpopulation can vary widely.",['However']
82,"Clinical trials, as well as animalstudies, have demonstrated multiple psychedelics, e.g., psilocybinand DMT, have fast-acting and long-lasting anti-depressant
properties ( Johnson et al., 2011 ;Robson et al., 2012 ;Palhano-
Fontes et al., 2019 ).","['Fontes', 'Clinical', 'Palhano', 'Johnson', 'Robson']"
83,"Notably, non-serotonergic psychedelics like
ketamine demonstrate fast-acting, but short lived, anti-depressant
effects.",['Notably']
84,"The recent Breakthrough Therapy designation of psilocybin
for MDD and TRD by the FDA is a testament to its clinical potential.Of note, recent phase 2 double-blind trials for psilocybin-assistedpsychotherapy for TRD found that large (25 mg) doses were able toproduce signi ﬁcant remission in 29% and 20% participants at 3-
week and 12-week post-treatment ( Goodwin et al., 2022 ).
2.2.3 Anxiety disorders
Pathological anxiety is a state of exaggerated hypervigilance and
responsiveness to fearful stimuli and has various clinicalmanifestations.","['Breakthrough', 'Goodwin', 'The', 'Pathological', 'Anxiety', 'Therapy']"
85,"Anxiety disorders, including general anxietydisorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and PTSD, areamenable to psychedelic treatment.","['Anxiety', 'gene']"
86,"For instance, in phase 2 trialsof MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, 61% and 68% ofparticipants at 2 months and 1-year follow-ups, respectively, nolonger met PTSD diagnostic criteria ( Fe et al., 2019 ;Mithoefer et al.,
2019 ).","['Mithoefer', 'For']"
87,"Patients with remission have been reported to maintain
remission for up to 6 years ( Sessa et al., 2019 ).","['Patients', 'Sessa']"
88,"Notably, MDMA
is a potent stimulator of serotonin norepinephrine and oxytocinrelease, which could underlie the reported prosocial effects,emotional regulation, and attenuation of amygdala response toanxiogenic stimuli ( Morley and McGregor, 2000 ;Johansen and
Krebs, 2009 ;Carhart-Harris et al., 2014a ).
3 Psychedelic mode of action
The novel nature of psychedelic drugs might help advance and
reconstruct our paradigms for psychiatric disorders and thefundamental nature of consciousness.","['Morley', 'The', 'Johansen', 'Notably', 'Krebs', 'Harris', 'Psychedelic', 'Carhart']"

92,"There are circles left empty as a reminder for theyet validated mechanisms.
Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 04Acero et al.","['Pharmacology', 'There', 'Frontiers']"
93,"For instance, when neuroscience was a nascent
discipline, scientists grossly overemphasized the role of neurons inbrain function, due to their easy visualization and study using earlystaining techniques.",['For']
94,"However, we now know that glial cells –over 10-
fold more numerous than neurons –play key roles in regulating brain
function, homeostasis, remodeling, and perfusion, amongst many
others.",['However']
95,"Likewise, it is necessary for us to examine psychedelic
treatment through multiple scienti ﬁc lenses in order to fully
understand their effects.",['Likewise']
96,"Ultimately, it is unlikely that a singlemode of action can adequately account for the effects ofpsychedelics, instead, multi-faceted actions likely worksynergistically across multiple systems to provide robusttherapeutic effects ( Figure 1 ).
Despite advancements in understanding the various
mechanisms contributing to psychedelic therapeutic action, the
signiﬁcance of the subjective experience remains hotly contested
(Olson, 2021 ;Yaden and Grif ﬁths, 2021 ).","['Despite', 'Ultimately', 'Grif', 'Olson', 'Yaden', 'Figure']"
97,"Psychedelic-assisted
psychotherapy often aims to cultivate the profoundly meaningful,psychologically transformative experiences that often precede majorshifts in psychological wellbeing in patients.",['Psychedelic']
98,"Various scholars havedeveloped scales to quantify these experiences, which are oftenreferred to as “mystical ”,“peak ”,“or“spiritual ”(Zamberlan et al.,
2018 ;Yaden and Newberg, 2022 ).","['Various', 'Zamberlan', 'Newberg', 'Yaden']"
99,"For example, the Mystical
Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), measures seven components ofexperience: 1) internal of unity (“merging with ultimate reality ”or
“pure awareness ”); 2) external unity (“all is one ”or“all things are
alive ”); 3) transcendence of time and space ,4 ) ineffability and
paradoxicality (difﬁculty describing the experience in words); 5)
sense of sacredness (awe); 6) noetic quality (intuitive knowledge of
ultimate reality or self), 7) deeply felt positive mood .","['Mystical', 'Questionnaire', 'Experience', 'For']"
100,"Those seeking an
in-depth exploration can refer to Yaden and Newberg ’s work, The
Varieties of Spiritual Experience , which provides a thorough
multidisciplinary review of the research ( Yaden and Newberg,
2022 ).Studies suggest that the subjective intensity and quality of
peak psychedelic (or “mystical ”) experience, e.g., ego death and
increased sense of connection, is predictive of psychedelic-assisted
therapy ef ﬁcacy ( Barrett et al., 2017 ;Prelle et al., 2017 ;Roseman
et al., 2018 ;Swanson, 2018 ).","['Those', 'Barrett', 'Studies', 'Newberg', 'The', 'Swanson', 'Varieties', 'Prelle', 'Spiritual', 'Yaden', 'Roseman', 'Experience']"
101,"In the Altered States of Consciousness
(ASC) questionnaire, scores on the Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN)
scale, which quanti ﬁes mystical states of mind, were notably more
predictive of positive clinical outcomes for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) than scores related to altered visual orauditory perception ( Roseman et al., 2018 ).","['Oceanic', 'Altered', 'Consciousness', 'States', 'Boundlessness', 'Roseman']"
102,"Further clarifying the
role of the subjective experience, a recent cross-sectional surveystudy examining the effects of psychedelic experiences, it was foundthat both mystical-type experiences and psychological insights
during the psychedelic experience were associated with
subsequent decreases in depression and anxiety ( Davis et al.,
2015 ).","['Davis', 'Further']"
103,"Moreover, they demonstrated that increased psychological
ﬂexibility was a mediator in the relationship between these acute
psychedelic effects and the observed decreases in depression andanxiety symptoms ( Davis et al., 2015 ).","['Moreover', 'Davis']"
104,"Notably, insightful as well as
mystical-type experiences have been identi ﬁed as subtypes of the
phenomenon of quantum change , i.e., “a sudden, distinctive,
benevolent, and enduring experience resulting in personal
transformations that affect a broad range of personal emotions,cognitions, and behavior ”(Davis et al., 2015 ).Moreover, non-psychedelic, or non-subjective, analogs of these
drugs may provide insight into the clinical signi ﬁcance of the acute

et al., 2012 ;Chen et al., 2014 ;Grothusen and Liu, 2019 ).","['Administration', 'Liu', 'Grothusen', 'Wang', 'Chen', 'Unfortunately']"
413,"Moreover,
salvinorin A is an extremely potent vascular dilator, even underhypocarbia and endothelin induced vasoconstrictive conditions ( Su
et al., 2011 ).",['Moreover']
414,"Salvinorin A preserves cerebrovascular function in part
by stimulating nitric oxide (NO) production and activation of
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS).",['Salvinorin']
415,"Endogenous elevationendothelial NOS levels in microvasculature following strokeinjury are thought to confer a protective effect from secondaryinjury, so it is possible salvinorin A is enhancing this endogenousmechanism.",['Endogenous']
416,"Acute intranasal administration of salvinorin A wasalso shown to reduce infarct volume and improve neurologicaloutcomes in a rhesus monkey ischemic stroke model ( Wu et al.,
2020 ).",['Acute']
417,"Salvinorin A might be most advantageous administered
immediately after injury, while patients await pre-surgical CTscans, because it will immediately restore blood ﬂow and could
provide neuroprotective effects.
Following stroke, microglia and in ﬁltrating immune cells, e.g.,
macrophages and lymphocytes, produce an exacerbated immuneresponse that causes chronic complications.","['Salvinorin', 'Following']"
418,"Cannabinoid receptor 1(CB1) is expressed in neurons and immune cells, and its activation
has been shown to produce neuroprotective effects in ischemia.
Although salvinorin A is often referred to as a selective KOR agonist,computation studies have shown a high docking ef ﬁciency between
salvinorin A and CB1.","['receptor', 'Although', 'Cannabinoid']"
419,"Moreover, salvinorin A stimulation mayinduce the formation of functional heterodimers between the tworeceptors ( Xu et al., 2016 ).","['Moreover', 'receptor']"
420,"In fact, salvinorin A activation of
CB1 signaling has been shown to be necessary for mediatingvarious behavioral effects and physiological effects across animal
models ( Braida et al., 2007 ;Fichna et al., 2009 ).","['Braida', 'Fichna']"
421,"For instance,
salvinorin A at picomolar concentrations has been shown toinhibit LPS-stimulated macrophage production of nitrite, TNF-alpha, and IL-10, by activation of KORs and CB1 receptors

relationship between KORs and CB1 receptors merit detailedinvestigation and may inform the ongoing development ofsalvinorin A analogs.
Stroke is often modelled in vitro by inducing ischemia-like
conditions via an oxygen and glucose deprivation paradigm,which can be readily and simply applied to most tissue models.One notable model for stroke research is the commercially available
Flocel DIV-BBB3D system which supports a 3D co-culture of brain
endothelial cells and astrocytes, while also providing ﬂow and
permitting investigation of leukocyte transmigration ( Holloway
and Gavins, 2017 ).","['Aviello', 'Stroke', 'Gavins', 'The', 'One', 'Flocel', 'Holloway', 'receptor']"
423,"3D multi-cellular models such as this would
be ideal for more re ﬁned assessments of how salvinorin A protects
BBB integrity, and how distinct cell-types mediate this effect.
Although there is a plethora of in vitro and in vivo injury
paradigms, it is crucial to identify functional measures that re ﬂect
human brain injury-induced de ﬁcits.",['Although']
424,"For example, stroke patients often
experience cognitive fatigue and attention de ﬁcits during recovery
(Johansson and Rönnbäck, 2012 ;Barman et al., 2016 ).","['Barman', 'Johansson', 'For']"
425,"Here, Hosking et al.","['Hosking', 'Here']"
426,"developed a rodent model of willingness
to expend cognitive effort, by which a rat can either engage a low-effortand low-reward task or a high-effort and high-reward task ( Hosking
et al., 2016 ).",['Hosking']
427,"This model demonstrated that cortical network
recruitment directly re ﬂected willingness to engage in high-effort
tasks.",['This']
428,"Alternatively, nest-building activity in mice following stroke isa multi-faceted functional measur e of long-term sensorimotor and
cognitive de ﬁcits ( Yuan et al., 2018 ).","['Alternatively', 'Yuan']"

contextually relevant assessme nt of stroke induced cognitive and
behavioral impairment and can help assess whether psychedelicsmight worsen or improve cognitive p rocessing, fatigue, and behavior

4.2.3 Psychedelic-assisted therapy for brain injury
patients
It is crucial to consider that stroke and TBI patients are more
predisposed to developing a psychiatric disorder, e.g., SUD, MDD,or PTSD ( Kaplan et al., 2018 ;Ponsford et al., 2018 ).","['Ponsford', 'Kaplan', 'Psychedelic', 'These']"
431,"At present, it is
unclear whether this elevated risk is due to the neuropathology of

Regardless, it is possible the comorbid neuropathologies of braininjury and psychological disorders will modulate the ef ﬁcacy and
safety pro ﬁle of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.",['Regardless']
433,"For instance, it
is unclear whether changes in blood pressure and cerebrovascularactivity may introduce health risks in TBI patients.",['For']
434,"Notably, Davis et al surveyedUS Special Operations Forces Veterans treated with ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT for psychological trauma and found that most patientsself-reported increased psychological ﬂexibility, reductions in
cognitive impairment, and reductions in symptoms of PTSD,depression, and anxiety, despite 82% of patients having sustainedhead injury ( Davis et al., 2020 ).","['Veterans', 'Davis', 'Notably', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Operations']"
435,"These results, and lack of adverse
outcomes, may indicate that there are not elevated risks within the
TBI patient population.",['These']
436,"Nonetheless, studies that control injury typeand severity (e.g., mild, moderate, and severe) will be necessary tohelp assess the ef ﬁcacy of psychedelic treatments for comorbid
psychiatric conditions in TBI patients.
To determine the ef ﬁcacy of psychedelics in comorbid patients,
researchers should combine animal models of psychiatric disorderswith TBI and stroke injury paradigms.",['Nonetheless']
437,"For instance, Perez-Garcia
et al.","['Garcia', 'Perez', 'For']"
438,"Yet, blast-exposurecould induce PTSD related traits in the absence of aphysiological stressor ( Perez-Garcia et al., 2016 ;Perez-Garcia
et al., 2019 ).","['Yet', 'Perez', 'Garcia']"
439,"While rat TBI models are often scienti ﬁcally
relevant, they are generally not translational, due to poorreplication of the head injury biomechanics (i.e., head rotational-
acceleration), brain mass, and neuroanatomy (i.e., gyrencephalic
with large white matter domains) that are drivers of TBI in humans.Accordingly, our lab utilizes a porcine model of head rotationalacceleration, which has been shown to produce the same tissuedeformation patterns, recovery delays, neuropathology, andinﬂammation pro ﬁles implicated in human TBI ( Cullen et al.,
2016 ;Wofford et al., 2021 ;Grovola et al., 2023 ).","['Grovola', 'While', 'Cullen', 'Accordingly', 'gene', 'Wofford']"
440,"This injury
paradigm could be applied in conjunction with a porcine
psychosocial chronic stress model that assesses the development
of a depressive phenotype using behavioral, endocrine, and gutbiomarkers.",['This']
441,"Researchers have already begun to utilize the porcinemodel and characterize changes in gene expression following asingle dose of psilocybin ( Donovan et al., 2021 ).","['gene', 'Researchers', 'Donovan']"
442,"Together, these
models will allow researchers to examine the therapeutic potentialfor psychedelics, as well as uncovering possible adverse side effectsand risks for TBI patients.
4.3 Psychedelic interactions in the
gastrointestinal tract
The GI tract regulates gut motility, local sensory processing,
epithelial and immune function, appropriate microbiota responses,appetite, metabolism, and CNS function via the “gut-brain axis ”
described earlier ( Morais et al., 2021 ).","['The', 'Morais', 'Psychedelic', 'Together']"
443,"Absorption and digestion-
related roles can also extend to the coordination of defenseprocesses, like diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting, to eliminatetoxic or indigestible substances or pathogenic microbes.",['Absorption']
444,"Collectively,this wide range of functions has major implications for various to
different aspects of clinical psychedelic administration.",['Collectively']
445,"Thisincludes identifying patients who do not respond to psychedelictherapy ( “non-responder patient populations ”), strategies to
minimize potential harm ( “harm reduction ”), and ways to
optimize therapeutic outcomes ( “beneﬁt maximization ”).
4.3.1 Intestinal in ﬂammation
Inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and debilitating
multifactorial disease that has increased with industrialization andresults in over $8 billion in healthcare-related costs annually in theUnited States alone ( Alatab et al., 2020 ).","['States', 'Thisincludes', 'Intestinal', 'Alatab']"
446,"It is generally characterized
by inﬂammation of the intestine (ulcerative colitis) or any part of the
GI tract (Crohn ’s disease), with 20% –50% of patients displaying
behavioral disturbances, e.g., depression, anxiety, and visceral pain,
that can predict relapse and disease severity ( Bisgaard et al., 2022 ).
Interestingly, nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂammatory drugs and
immunosuppressant therapy are commonly prescribed to patientsand can sometimes reduce behavioral symptoms.","['Bisgaard', 'Crohn', 'gene', 'Interestingly']"
447,"Conversely,cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy andhypnotic therapy have moderate success for some IBD patientsin conjunction with dietary interventions ( Ehrmann et al., 2020 ).
Most treatment options for this disease, however, do not “cure ”it
but rather serve to manage symptoms.","['Ehrmann', 'Most', 'Conversely']"
448,"Relatedly, disorders of gut-brain interaction, mainly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are asigniﬁcant global health burden, affecting 40% of the population,
and are characterized by any combination of motility disturbance,visceral hypersensitivity, altered mucosal and immune function,altered gut microbiota, and altered CNS processing ( Keefer et al.,
2022 ).","['Relatedly', 'Keefer']"
449,"IBS is often associated with dysregulated serotonin signaling,
which regulated gut motility; patients fall into diarrhea,
constipation, or diarrhea and constipation subtypes.
In non-comorbid settings, antidepressants are emerging as
possible therapies for IBD and serotonergic drugs are currenttreatments for IBS ( Ehrmann et al., 2020 ).",['Ehrmann']
450,"Patients with IBS
receiving antidepressant treatment reported bene ﬁts with visceral
pain and gut motility ( Ehrmann et al., 2020 ).","['Patients', 'Ehrmann']"
451,"Similarly, several
psychedelics have demonstrated in vivo therapeutic effects in
attenuating intestinal in ﬂammation.",['Similarly']
452,"Ketamine reduced
histological damage after dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment,a chemical method to induce epithelial damage in the ceca of miceand reduced local necroptosis, an in ﬂammatory cell death, as well as

psychedelic demonstrating the greatest ef ﬁcacy in attenuating
peripheral in ﬂammation of any approved therapeutic, was able to
reduce IL-6 and IL-1b levels in the small intestine, but not the colon,

454,"DMT and
5Meo-DMT reduced IFNg and IL-17 production in T cells in vitro
by impairing pro-in ﬂammatory activation of human monocyte
derived dendritic cells via Sigmar-1 ( Szabo et al., 2014 ).
Salvinorin A reduced myeloperoxidase activity as well as grosshistological damage in both TNBS and DSS models of colitis thatwere accompanied by reduced visceral pain-related behaviors inmice in a KOR-dependent manner ( Fichna et al., 2012 ;Sałaga et al.,
2014 ).","['Salvinorin', 'Szabo', 'Sigmar', 'Fichna']"

458,"We provide an overview of the possiblemechanisms by which psychedelic compounds may modulate
intestinal in ﬂammation in Figure 10 .",['Figure']
459,"An important consideration
is the heterogeneity of patients with these diseases; differentpsychedelics will not be effective for all clinical presentations andcould be potentially harmful for some (e.g., IBS-diarrhea patients),thus more in vivo mechanistic preclinical studies are needed to
understand how they work in the intestine and GI tract morebroadly ( Nichols, 2022 ).
4.3.2 Side effects
Common side effects of oral drugs, including psychedelics like
ayahuasca, ibogaine, and psilocybin mushrooms, include nausea,vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.","['Side', 'Common', 'gene', 'Nichols']"
460,"Generally, nausea andvomiting processes are carried out by afferent vagal nerve signalsfrom the gut to different brain regions, with a major role for 5-HT
3,
an ion channel receptor, whereas diarrhea and constipation arelimited to the GI tract, speci ﬁcally epithelial tight junctions ( Mawe
and Hoffman, 2013 ).","['Generally', 'Hoffman', 'gene', 'receptor', 'Mawe']"
461,"While the exact mechanism behind these side
effects is not known, it is hypothesized that serotonin agonism bytheir psychoactive counterparts: DMT, noribogaine, and psilocin,respectively, in the intestine is the main driver, with a smallercontribution of non-psychoactive compounds like harmine inayahuasca and non-digestible chitin in psilocybin mushrooms.However, this does not fully explain how or why side effects varywidely among individuals and whether this correlates to
physiological or psychological changes in the brain.","['While', 'However']"
462,"Additionally,

463,"mirabilis in
non-antibiotic treated rats supporting the mediating role of the gutﬂora in mitigating dangerous side effects ( Ridge et al., 2019 ).

464,"Intestinal alkaline phosphatase, the
enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating psilocybin to psilocin, is
a common marker for differentiated intestinal epithelial cells.","['enzyme', 'Intestinal']"
465,"Peoplewith nonfunctional genetic mutations in cytochrome p450 genes,expressed in the liver and intestine, have higher serum levels of LSDat least 24 h post administration ( Vizeli et al., 2021 ).","['Vizeli', 'gene', 'Peoplewith']"
466,"Moreover,
individual features of the GI milieu, such as the gut microbiota andhost genetics may underlie differences in psychedelic ef ﬁcacy and
side effects.
4.3.3 Intestinal epithelium
While many studies have looked at direct immunological effects,
either in vitro, in vivo systemically, or in vivo in the intestine, studies
have overlooked the effects of psychedelics on all other cell types inthe intestine, most of which express serotonin receptors, forexample, ( Mawe and Hoffman, 2013 ).","['While', 'Moreover', 'Hoffman', 'gene', 'Intestinal', 'receptor', 'Mawe']"
467,"Kim and Ingber et al developed a micro ﬂuidic “Gut-on-a-
Chip ”technology where human Caco-2 epithelial cells are exposed
to physiological peristalsis-like motions to induce self-organizationof cells into 3D intestinal villi ( Kim and Ingber, 2013 ).","['Caco', 'Gut', 'Kim', 'Ingber', 'Chip']"
468,"Another
model, functional organoids, generated from intestinal stem cellsfrom human patients may also present a unique in vitro opportunity
to study intestinal in ﬂammation and side effects although
integration with other systems (microbial, immune, andneuronal) will require further optimization ( Min et al., 2020 ).
Gut-on-a-chip technology is ideal to assess the impact of
psychedelics on intestinal in ﬂammation under different
conditions (e.g., microbial colonization) and dissect mechanismsin a controlled manner not possible with existing in vitro orin vivo
models, while incorporation of organoids are useful for their clinicalrelevance ( Kim et al., 2012 ;Kim et al., 2016 ;Jalili-Firoozinezhad
et al., 2019 ;Angus et al., 2020 ).","['Gut', 'Jalili', 'Angus', 'gene', 'Another', 'Firoozinezhad', 'Kim', 'Min']"
469,"Overall, micro ﬂuidics and organoid
models could be novel and effective tools for researchers to
investigate applications of psychedelics as potent
immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of intestinaldisorders like IBD and IBS.
5 Conclusion
Research into psychedelics not only offers the promise to greatly
improve wellbeing across multiple patient populations but may
fundamentally challenge and inform novel theories ofconsciousness, our understanding of psychiatric disorders, andhow to treat them.","['Research', 'Conclusion', 'Overall']"
470,"These investigations may also inform further,unimagined clinical applications and guidelines for psychedelic use.
In fact, there are other potential applications that merit
consideration, including neurodegenerative disorders andneurotrauma, as well as the potential role of the enteric nervoussystem and microbiome.","['gene', 'These']"
471,"However, it is crucial to underline theimportance of proper usage, backed by the comprehensive FDAapproval process, with a keen emphasis on strong safety data, and aclear understanding of potential side effects prior to the prescriptionof these compounds for speci ﬁc disorders.",['However']
472,"We hope this review, bysummarizing the potential modes of action and novel therapeuticapplications, serves to expand the horizon for future pre-clinical andclinical investigations with psychedelic compounds.
